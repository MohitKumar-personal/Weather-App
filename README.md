# Weather App

This Flutter-based weather application provides real-time weather updates for any specified city. Users can enter the name of any city to retrieve current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The application remembers the last searched city across sessions using shared preferences, ensuring data persistence. Users can refresh the weather data to get the most current information available. With a responsive design, the user interface adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, offering a seamless experience on both phones and tablets. Leveraging the Weather API to fetch and display weather data in a user-friendly interface, this cross-platform application is built with Flutter, making it suitable for both Android and iOS devices.
